# This script prepares an offline C++ toolchain directory under vendor/cpp-wasm/
# by copying or downloading prebuilt assets and generating a worker from a template.
#
# Usage options:
#   1) Local copy: place your toolchain at a path and run:
#        TOOLSRC=/path/to/cpp-wasm bash tools/fetch_cpp_offline.sh
#      Expected files inside $TOOLSRC: worker.js (or clang.js/wasm with your own worker)
#      The script will copy into vendor/cpp-wasm/.
#
#   2) Custom URL base (advanced):
#        URL_BASE=https://example.com/cpp-wasm bash tools/fetch_cpp_offline.sh
#      Must host worker.js and any dependent assets at that base; the script will mirror worker.js only.
#
#   3) Manual: see README â€“ implement /vendor/cpp-wasm/worker.js yourself using tools/cpp-wasm/worker.template.js.
